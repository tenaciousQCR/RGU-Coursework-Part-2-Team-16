     <p>The aim of the industrial placement is to provide students with the opportunity to consolidate and broaden the knowledge they have gained in their studies. The working environment allows students to apply their academic knowledge and skills to a real world situation. By undertaking a placement during your studies, you will make valuable links with industry and have a definite advantage when you apply for graduate jobs. Placements allow students to use the skills they have developed while studying and build on them in a real world situation. The benefits for both employers and students are huge; students learn from working alongside professionals and employers benefit from a valuable resource with valuable skills, knowledge and fresh ideas. </p>
