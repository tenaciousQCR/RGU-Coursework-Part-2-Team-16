    <h2>Aberdeen data company snaps up RGU grads</h2>
    <p id="date">Wednesday, 26 October, 2016</p>
    <h3>An Aberdeen company which provides operational reporting solutions to the upstream oil and gas industry has snapped up five Robert Gordon University (RGU) graduates and current students to more than double its current team.</h3>

        <p> Independent Data Services (IDS) has recruited four graduates from RGU’s School of Computer Science and Digital Media, with Michal Drobena (32); Ross McLean (23); Jess Dunham (23); and Tiffany Young (21) all taking up positions with the company, alongside current student Mindaugas Uzubalis (24).</p>

        <p>Michal who graduated with a Masters in IT for the Oil and Gas Industry and Business Information Systems graduate Ross joins as Data Analysts, while Computing for Internet and Multimedia student Mindaugas and Computer Science graduate Jess each take up the role of Business Intelligence Analyst. Business Information Systems graduate Tiffany has been appointed as Junior Account Manager at the company.</p>

        <p>Program Manager at IDS, Colin Dawson, said: “In being an RGU graduate and current student myself, I know first-hand the skills and experience that RGU graduates bring to the table. Most have experience in oil and gas or at least some exposure to the challenges that exist in the technology sector in this market, which is key to what we do at IDS.</p>

        <p>“The employment market across Aberdeen is awash with data managers, and ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) qualified service delivery managers but it lacks data scientists and product visionaries. </p>

        <p>"The RGU culture not only provides in-depth knowledge of the subject matter, but also prompts students to develop innovative & disruptive solutions."</p>

        <p>Senior lecturer at RGU’s School of Computing Science and Digital Media, Dr Ines Arana, said: “The School places great emphasis on the industry focus of its undergraduate and postgraduate courses, benefitting from a panel of industrialists whose opinion is sought to ensure the currency, desirability and demand of the courses’ content.</p>

        <p>“A substantial element of practical experience is included in all its courses. For example, case studies from industry are used to enhance the students’ understanding of concepts and to develop their hands-on computing experience and some students undertake an industry-proposed final project and all students undertake some collaborative work where they learn transferrable skills such as team-working. <p>

        <p>“The students’ learning experience is often enhanced by an optional placement, normally at a local business. IDS has been very supportive of our computing students and graduates, offering both industrial projects and employment, as well as having an input in the School’s research.</p>

        <p>“It is great to see that our graduates are so highly thought of within the industry and I am sure they are looking forward to starting their professional careers.”</p>
